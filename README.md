# Tour
a lil tour about 4ME
## Running a 4ME program
To run a 4ME program in a offline python interpreter (like using a python extension for VSCode, which is fast btw). You must follow these steps

* Download the source code of either 4me.py or fme.py (in the Rewritten 4me folder of this repo)
* Make a file compatible with your 4ME variant (N4ME: `.wm`, R4ME: `.4`,)
* Find your file and submit it to your interpreter (unless if you're using R4ME, make sure to write the name for your `.4` file in the file name input section and hopefully your `.4` file is inside the interpreters path)
* Oh cool you complete the Running a 4ME program tutorial. You can repeat from 2nd (or 3rd) step of this tutorial
